# FEAT

**Feat** (Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types) provides enumerations as functions from natural numbers to values.
Based on paper [Feat: Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types](https://doi.org/10.1145/2430532.2364515). This library is an implementation of the theory explained in the paper with some modification in order to fit in MoonBit language.

This can be used for systematic testing like smallcheck, or style random testing, and hybrids of the two.

## How To Use

The enumerators are defined in a very boilerplate manner but currently MoonBit does not provide any meta programming features. You can check the files in `lib` directory which ended with `test_.mbt` to find the usage.
